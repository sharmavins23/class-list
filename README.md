# Class List

This is a small implementation of this neat little card-based modal on
[Coursicle](https://www.coursicle.com/cmu/courses/ECE/) with an accompanying
search box.

In particular, with CSS mockups my goal is to implement small functional
portions that can later be merged into a personal portfolio. Creating a small
course listing with searchable tags/filters would allow for a neat and quickly
interactive display of what courses I have taken in my schooling.
